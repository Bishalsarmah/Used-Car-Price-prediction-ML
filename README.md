## Used Car Price Prediction Machine Learning Model
This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting the prices of used cars based on various features.

## Overview
In this project, I developed a machine learning model using Python and popular libraries like scikit-learn and pandas to predict the prices of used cars.
The model is trained on a dataset containing features such as car name , year of manufacturing, mileage, fuel type, and more. 

## Dataset
The dataset (cardetails.csv) used for training and testing the model is included in this repository.
